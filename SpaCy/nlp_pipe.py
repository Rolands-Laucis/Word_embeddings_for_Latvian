#this script does NLP tasks for testing created word embeddings using python nlp SpaCy lib. For training POS and NER tagger and using them to evaluate embeddings.

#On the site https://spacy.io/usage/training there is a tool to generate a base_config.cfg file, that you can download. For this the tagger was selected in the tool and for accuracy 
#the tagger will only generate tags as token.tag_ which are fine-grained pos.
#then that config needs to be filled in with all the other defaults. This generates the config.cfg
#python -m spacy init fill-config base_config-tag.cfg config.cfg

#if you want to access token.pos_ which is coarse-grained (e.g. NOUN, VERB...), you need to include a morphologizer component in the config under [components]
#this is done by creating a template config morfo-config file and copy pasting its morphologizer component into config.cfg under [components] and "morphologizer" under [nlp]
#spacy init config -p tagger,morphologizer,parser morfo-config.cfg

#For training a model, you need a .spacy format file. To generate it, you use the covert method https://spacy.io/api/cli#convert with options
#i converted all 3 (train, dev, test) .conllu files this way from https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Latvian-LVTB
#python -m spacy convert lv_lvtb-ud-test.conllu .\ --converter conllu

#To insert my word embeddings into spaCy, covert them to .spacy format. Embeddings need to be .txt with the first line speficying stats about vectors:
#python -m spacy init vectors lv ../../Models/SSG_model/ssg_5_350_sg.txt ../../Models/Spacy_tagger/ssg_5_350_vectors --name lv-ssg-5-350

#Then in the config.cfg under [Initialize] set vectors = ^ that path where it output without ""

#under [training] set max_epochs = 10 for consistent results. This takes about 2h. Otherwise it says 0 and means unlimited epochs, bet eventually stops training past 100 epochs.

#Train the custom model to use in the spaCy nlp pipeline for tagging later.
#python -m spacy train config.cfg --output ../../Models/Spacy_tagger/ssg_5_350_pos --paths.train ./lv_lvtb-ud-train.spacy --paths.dev ./lv_lvtb-ud-dev.spacy

#optionally verify config stats are in there like POS tags, embeddings...:
#python -m spacy debug data ../../Models/Spacy_tagger/ssg_5_200_pos/model-last/config.cfg

#Then run this script to do a POS tag
#python nlp_pipe.py

import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("../../Models/Spacy_tagger/ssg_5_350_pos/model-best/")

#print(nlp.pipeline)
doc = nlp("astronomija uzb큰vi izvietojumu kust카bu un att카st카bu.")

print("Word | UPOS | TAG")
for token in doc:
    #print(token.text, token.pos)
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.tag_)
