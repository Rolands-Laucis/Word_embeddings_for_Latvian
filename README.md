## Abstract:
# 

Each python script contains a header line explaining its purpose and CLI use examples.
There are also automation .bat files for running model training and evaluation.

The work is done using the python language.
FastText and Word2vec embeddings are trained with the python lib "Gensim".
Ngram2vec and Structure Skip-Gram embeddings are trained with a tool from their original github repositories.

The SpaCy directory contains all source code files and instructions for building and evaluating POS and NER models using custom latvian word embeddings.
